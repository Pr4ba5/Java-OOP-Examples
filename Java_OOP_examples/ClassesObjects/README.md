# 🚗 Java OOP: Classes and Objects

## 🔷 THE CONCEPT

As we know, **Java is an object-oriented programming language**.

Now it means it organizes code around **objects** rather than actions. The fundamental building blocks of Java are:

- **Classes**: Blueprints for an object. They define attributes and methods.
- **Objects**: Instances of classes, created at runtime, that hold the actual values and perform operations.

### 🧠 OK, LET'S SEE WITH A REAL LIFE ANALOGY

Think of a **car**:
- A **class** could be `Car` which has its attributes like `speed`, `color`, etc.
- And methods like `startCar()`, `openWindows()`, `brake()`.

Now an **object** would be something specific like a **Lamborghini** with **black color** and **200 km/h current speed**.

## ❓ WHEN AND WHY TO USE??

Use **classes and objects** when you want to **model real-world entities** in your application.

It can be helpful for:
- ✅ Code **reusability**
- ✅ **Encapsulation** of data and logic
- ✅ **Modularity** and **maintainability** of code
