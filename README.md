# 🧠 Java-OOP-Examples 🤓💻

Welcome to the **Java OOP Playground**, where classes have feelings, inheritance comes with no taxes, and polymorphism doesn’t require a biology degree.

This repo is your *"laugh-while-you-learn"* tour of the fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. Whether you're a beginner, a job-seeker, or just someone procrastinating better things, you're in the right place.

## 🧩 What's Inside?

| # | Topic | Description |
|--:|:------|:------------|
| 01 | **Classes & Objects** | Where Java objects are born. Think of it as the birth certificate of your code. |
| 02 | **Constructors** | Because every object needs a dramatic entrance. |
| 03 | **Inheritance** | Like family traits, but with fewer awkward Thanksgivings. |
| 04 | **Polymorphism** | One method, many disguises. Like a Java-powered superhero. 🦸‍♂️ |
| 05 | **Abstraction** | We hide things. Not emotionally, just logically. |
| 06 | **Encapsulation** | Wrapping data like a burrito 🌯 — tightly packed and secure. |
| 07 | **Interface vs Abstract** | It's like Coke vs Pepsi... but with Java. ⚔️ |
